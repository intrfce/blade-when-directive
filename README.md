# Laravel Inertia Components

> [!WARNING]  
> This package is in a pre-release state and the API may change.

This package allows you to create Livewire-style class components for your InertiaJS applications.

## Features:

- ✅ Define HTTP-named resourceful style methods for `show`/`store`/`update`/`destroy` right in the same class.
- ✅ Any `public` properties or methods pass data back to your components.
- ✅ Attributes to mark public methods as `#[Lazy]` or `#[Always]`
- ✅ Create methods that auto-wire their own routes by using the `#[PostAction]`, `#[GetAction]` etc Attributes.
- ⌛ Create components with `php artisan make:inertia`
- ✅ `Route::inertia` helper.

## Road to first release:

- [ ] Refactor attribute detection.
- [ ] Ensure registered routes are picked up by component injection.

## Why?

- Better organisation and encapsulation of code.
- Reduce clutter in your route files.

## HTTP/Resourceful Methods.

The base class reserves four `public` method names to use and their corresponding HTTP methods:

| Method Name | HTTP Method |
|-------------|  -----      |
 | show        | GET         |
| store       | POST |
| update      | PATCH/PUT |
 | destroy | DELETE |

Each of these methods behaves just like a controller method should, so you can inject route parameters and dependencies as needed:

```php
public function show(Request $request, string $id, ModelName $model): array {}
```

### Returning data from `show()`

The `show` method is used when your route is hit with a `GET` request.

If you return an `array` from this method, it will be merged with the rest of the public properties and methods, you can also
use the usual `Inertia::lazy` and `Inertia::always` closures from here too.

## Autowiring HTTP Methods.

If you need to call another route that's non-RESTful or tangential to the resource you're showing, you can use autowiring
methods, these will register the route for you with either an automatic or user-given URL.

For example, showing a list of blog posts on your `show` route, but want the ability to send a quick AJAX request to toggle 
the post as published or unpublished? 

Setup a function in your component, and add the appropriate HTTP method action attribute to it:

```php
#[PatchAction(url:'/{post}/toggle-published')]
function togglePublished(BlogPost $post) {
    $post->published = !$post->published;
    $post->save();
    return redirect()->back();
}
```

Assuming your component was registered with a path like `/posts`, this would automatically register a route at
`POST posts/{post}/toggle-published` for you.

> Note: if you use the `#[GetAction]` attribute, you shouldn't return an Inertia::response() from it - if you want to do that, use another
> fully registered route instead.

## Full (WIP) Example:

```php
<?php

class Dashboard extends Intrfce\InertiaComponents\InertiaComponent {

   // A template is required, or an exception will be thrown.
    protected $template = 'Dashboard/Index';

   // Any public properties are passed to inertia.
    public string $name = 'Dan';
    
    // As are any public methods.
    public function email(): string 
    {
      return 'dan@hello.com';
    }
    
    // You can mark any method as Inertia::lazy() with the #[Lazy] Attribute:
    #[Lazy]
    public function blogPosts(): Collection
    {
        return BlogPosts::all();
    }
    
    // You can mark any method as Inertia::always() with the #[Always] Attribute:
    #[Always]
    public function age(): int
    {
        return 36;
    }
    
    /** GET /dashboard */
    public function show(Request $request) {}
    
    /** POST /dashboard */
    public function store(Request $request) {}
    
    /** PUT/PATCH /dashboard */
    public function update(Request $request) {}
    
    /** DELETE /dashboard */
    public function destroy(Request $request) {}
    
    /** GET /dashboard/your-route - Autowired */
    #[GetAction('your-route')]
    public function getMoreStuff()
    {
    
    }
    
    /** POST /dashboard/your-route - Autowired */
    #[GetAction('your-route')]
    public function postMoreStuff()
    {
    
    }
    
    /** PATCH /dashboard/patch-more-stuff - Autowired  - notice the route URL derived from the function name */
    #[PatchAction()]
    public function patchMoreStuff()
    {
    
    }
    
    /** DELETE /dashboard/{item}/delete - Autowired */
    #[DeleteAction('{item}/delete')]
    public function deleteAnItem(ItemModel $item)
    {
    
    }

}
